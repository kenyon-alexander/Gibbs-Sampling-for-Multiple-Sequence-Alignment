# Gibbs-Sampling-for-Multiple-Sequence-Alignment
Written in C after Lawrence et al. 1993 in Science. I wrote this algorithm for a masters course in bioinformatics at Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris

A full description of the algorithm, code, and results can be found in the "Papier sur Gibbs Sampling.pdf" file. This file is unfortunately written in French, but if it can be understood it is quite informative. 

The following is a description of each file in the repository:

Fasta files for testing the algorithm:

  1. TestSeq2.fasta
  2. TestSeq3.fasta
  3. lipocalin.fst
  
Files containing the functions and main for the algorithm:

  1. gibbs_main.c
  2. gibbs_functions.h
